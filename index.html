              Programming is a deep and fascinating field. I find myself lucky to
              be in a place where I get to code day in and day out. The logic, creativity,
              patience and dedication it takes to bring a project together can seem
              like a large mountain to climb sometimes. But the reward of seeing a
              piece of code do its job exactly as you programmed it to is one of the
              most satisfying feelings there is.
              <br><br>
              I was introduced to Programming in the 10th grade. We were all given
              TI-83's and asked to write a program that solved a simple equation.
              I was hooked there and then. I spent the next few evenings filling my
              calculator with all the equations I needed for the next test, just because
              it was so interesting to create them.
              <br><br>
              From that time on, programming would be a hobby to me. I went through
              college as a philosophy student (I was planning on becoming a priest...
              until my wife came along). My classes though never really held my attention
              though. I always found myself working on some game in the back of the class.
              <br><br>
              After graduation, I went to work for a called US Airweld, where I did Hydrostatic
              Pressure Testing </a> of high-pressure cylinders. The best thing this
              job had to offer was a lot of free time to think, which I often used
              to contemplate the different programs I was working on.
              <br><br>
              That company eventually traded hands and I eventually ended up getting
              a referral from a friend to come be a programmer for the Paradise Valley
              School District. A place I have happily spent the last 4 years working
              on a student database of about 34,000 students.This job has provided
              a lot of interesting projects for me and I have grown a lot through
              the great opportunities they have given me.
              <br><br>
              Looking to the future, I am very excited by Big Data and the emerging
              field of Augmented Reality. The rich possibilities of both of these
              fields look to be able to produce a lot of good for the world and I
              am hoping to find a way to help where I can.
